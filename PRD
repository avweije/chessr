* Bugs / Todo

- when adding to your repertoire from analysis (open in new tab), i go to practice, but dont see them as 'new'


* Ideas for later:

Batch engine blunder-check for novelties only
→ Instead of analysing every move, just run Stockfish (or another UCI engine) on the first move that’s out of your repertoire. That gives you an immediate “is this dangerous?” signal.
