# Bugs / Todo

- when adding to your repertoire from analysis (open in new tab), i go to practice, but dont see them as 'new'
- opponent analysis - when you expand your repertoire, previously downloaded games are not checked anymore..? either make a fix or provide a reset or something?
- modals
- styling
- clicking on links few times goes wrong, after opening in new window through button? localhost:8000/repertoire/practice ?

- if repertoire updated, new items, do we need to recalculate recommended?? if we already have in session, it wont change until you play them all.. ?

- make pgn field (opponents) a component, hover is nice, keys left right up down (optional), click = callback, etc.

# Ideas for later:

Batch engine blunder-check for novelties only
→ Instead of analysing every move, just run Stockfish (or another UCI engine) on the first move that’s out of your repertoire. That gives you an immediate “is this dangerous?” signal.
