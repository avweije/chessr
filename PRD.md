# Todo

- move api functions to appropriate controllers, remove api controller.

- make a serializeRepertoire function to make a json array from a parameter => used XXX times in RepertoireService --> already have getMoveArray() need to further implement this..

- replace api calls for exclude/autoplay with /details api call

# Logger class

- logger class, default only logs for current page JS?
- components log under certain name or level, debug, something we can turn on/off quickly when we need it
- when we want to debug, option to turn on component debugs/infos
- when we are just working on 1 page, option to turn all other debugs/infos off
- can we use class or file to determine grouping?

# Bugs

-

# Ideas for later:

Batch engine blunder-check for novelties only
→ Instead of analysing every move, just run Stockfish (or another UCI engine) on the first move that’s out of your repertoire. That gives you an immediate “is this dangerous?” signal.
